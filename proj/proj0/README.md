# NBody Simulation

## Introduction
<p align="justify">
The goal of this project is to give you a crash course in Java. Since CS61B is not intended to be a course about Java, we will be moving quickly, learning fundamental aspects of the Java language in just four weeks.
<br><br>
Before starting this project, we are assuming that you either have prior Java experience, or have watched lecture 2 and (ideally) have also completed HW0. If you have not watched lecture 2, do so now. The code that I built during that lecture can be found at this link. You do not need to fully understand the contents of lecture 2 to begin this assignment. Indeed, the main purpose of this project is to help you build some comfort with the material in that lecture.
<br><br>
Unlike later projects, this assignment has a great deal of scaffolding. Future assignments will require significantly more independence. For this project, you may work in pairs. To work in a pair, you must read the collaboration guide and fill out the partner request form linked in the partnership guide. You do not need to wait for our approval to begin as long as you meet the requirements for partnerships. If you work with someone who is more experienced, you are likely to miss lots of important subtleties, which will be painful later when you start working on your own (i.e. the entire second half of the course).
<br><br>
Your goal for this project is to write a program simulating the motion of N objects in a plane, accounting for the gravitational forces mutually affecting each object as demonstrated by Sir Isaac Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation.
<br><br>
Ultimately, you will be creating a program NBody.java that draws an animation of bodies floating around in space tugging on each other with the power of gravity.
